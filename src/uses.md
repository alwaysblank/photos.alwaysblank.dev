I am very, _very_ much an amateur photographer, so don't expect too much here.

## Cameras

### Nikon D5000

This is the camera I use most of the time, mostly just because digital is way way easier to deal with these days.
I've had it for several years, and it's starting to show some wear and tear (the lid for the SD card has cracked off, and the autofocuses doesn't seem to be as good as it used to be), but it's still good for what I ask it to do and a new camera is very expensive.

#### Lenses

 - **AF-S Nikkor 18-55mm**  
    This was the lens that came with the body when I got the camera.
    It works fine, although for the stuff I like to take photos of (i.e. landscapes) I feel like it sits in a weird spot;
    It's not wide enough to really take in a lot, but it doesn't have any appreciable zoom to let me get closer to stuff.
    Beyond that, I'm not familiar enough with the intricacies of lenses to say anything deep about it.

 - **AF-S Nikkor 55-200mm**  
    I still haven't gotten over the excitement of being able to zoom in on things, so I like using this lens just because I can zoom in on stuff.
    It allows to to sometimes take pictures which feel a bit more candid, which is nice because I don't like things that feel too staged, but it do wish it had a bit more zoom.

### Pentax P30t

This was my first camera.
It used to belong to my grandpa, and when he learned I was getting into photography I supposed he decided he wasn't using it anymore and gave it to me.
It's a nice little camera and I enjoy using it (there's something about shooting on actual film that still feels more exciting that digital), but unfortunately dealing with film is both slightly expensive and a hassle, so I don't do it as much as I wish I did.
It does _not_ have autofocus, so it's definitely a bit more work for me.

#### Lenses

 - **SMC Pentax-A 50mm**  
    More or less the default lens for this guy, I think.
    Not really anything clever to say here; it works, and I don't know that much about lenses.

 - **Tamron 70-210mm**  
    Another long lens!
    See the pattern?
    Like the another zoom lense I have more fun with this one, just because I like getting close to stuff without being...too close to it.

## Develop

For film, I just send it off to be developed.
I recently got a film scanner to scan negatives with, but I haven't had the oportunity to try it out yet.

For digital photography, (and eventually for scans) I've been using [darktable](https://www.darktable.org/), mostly because it's free and I don't want to pay for Lightroom for something that's currently just a light hobby.
It's got plenty of...stuff I can do, but I have no idea what most of it does, or really how to get the most out of editing stuff in it anyway.
