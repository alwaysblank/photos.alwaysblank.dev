My sister was coming over to the coast from Idaho, and my wife and I hadn't seen her since her wedding sometime last year because of the pandemic. My mom and dad hadn't seen her in almost as long. So we all drove over to the coast to spend the day together.

These photos were taken at [Beverly Beach State Park](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&parkId=164) (and some of them further down the 101, near [Yachats](https://www.yachats.org/)). I also took a few on a nearly 20-year-old role of drugstore film, but I haven't gotten that developed yetâ€”I'll add it to this roll when I get around to that.
