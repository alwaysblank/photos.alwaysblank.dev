Portland has a yearly Winter Lights Festival, and we've never managed to go before. It was pretty cool, but ended up being _much_ busier than we'd thought--some of the large displays had an almost rave-like atmosphere, complete with people in what I can only describe as "rave gear." Overall it was a really fun thing, though, and it was cool to see so many people out in Downtown Portland. 

I didn't get a lot of photos, but I was _very_ impressed with the low-light performance of the RP and my 50mm prime lens.
