For the second time in as many years, the company I work for held a retreat at the [Sou'Wester](https://www.souwesterlodge.com/), a place that describes itself as a "resort" but that I would probably call more of a "getaway." Which isn't a dig: I love it there, and I can't wait to go back.

Unfortunately, I was so busy relaxing that I didn't take many photos. The ones I did take (this roll) were while we were helping to shoot [a movie my boss's kid was making](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWmmDHTm9A), which accounts for some of the otherwise-obtuse subject matter.
