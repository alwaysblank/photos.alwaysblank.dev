My wife and I took a short day trip out to the coast to visit Astoria, one of our favorite local destinations. We went and visited the Astoria Column (for the first time) but we got there late in the day and the light was gone before we could get to other interesting-to-photograph locations.

These are the digital photos I took; I also took some color and black-and-white film photos on the trip, and I'll update this with those photos once I've got them.
