I recently bought a "new" camera, a Nikon F4. I've been wanting to do more film photography, because it's fun, and the F4 seemed like a good balance of "not horribly expensive," "good," and "built like a tank." I also got some second-hand lenses to use on it (the kit lenses from my D5000 fit it, but they're DX lenses so they're not ideal, and it's old enough that it doesn't support VR), which I [tried out on my D5000 a few weeks ago](/rolls/backyard-lens-test/).

The first couple of rolls I shot on the F4 are back, and these are some of my favorite shots! I'm scanning them myself, and when I scanned these I hadn't developed a good system for keeping everything clean, so I apologize for the dust and dog/cat hairs in the scans.
