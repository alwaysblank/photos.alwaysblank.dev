In late 2020 and early 2021, I shot a few rolls of film and then foolishly let them sit around my house for months. I strongly suspect the heat in the house negatively affected the quality of the negatives, because some of them turned out looking...bad. I feel especially sad about that because at least one of them was a roll of Ektar--a stock I've never used before--and I was interested to see how they came out. Unfortunately, a combination of not knowing what I was doing when I shot it and the aforementioned conditions results in some kind of strange prints--most unusable, the rest too dark or with very strange colors. I'll try again, I'm sure, but obviously I need more practice.
