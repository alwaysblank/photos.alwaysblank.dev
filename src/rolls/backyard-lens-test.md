I recently got a new _film_ camera (a Nikon F4) as well as some new lenses, primarily for use on the F4 (even though they're AF lenses, my D5000 won't actually autofocus with them), although they'll mount on my digital camera as well. Some of them offer new capabilities (in addition to having slightly better optics than my kit lenses, I think) like a longer zoom or a macro option, so I tried a few of them out.

Unfortunately, while I've been shooting film on the F4, I haven't gotten any of it developed yet, so the following is all digital.
