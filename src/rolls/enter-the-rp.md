My old Nikon D5000 was giving up the ghost, so to replace it (and to celebrate a new job), I got myself a [Canon EOS RP](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/myportal/us/home/products/details/cameras/eos-dslr-and-mirrorless-cameras/mirrorless/eos-rp), as well as two cheap lenses for it: A 50mm and a 24mm-105mm. So far I've shot almost everything I've shot with the 50mm. I've never had a prime lens before, and the speed of the lens in combination with the good low-light performance of the RP has given me some shots that look pretty awesome to me.
