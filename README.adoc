== How's It Work?

Each roll defines an `album`, which is the path to a folder on my Cloudinary account.
When a build is run (only locally, currently) the script checks to see if a file containing data for that album exist; if it does, then it builds the site from that. 
If it doesn't, it pulls the necessary info from Cloudinary via the Admin API, saves it to a file, and then builds the site.
It does this for faster builds on old rolls, but also to keep from hitting the API a ton--the Admin API is rate-limited to around 500 calls an hour.
